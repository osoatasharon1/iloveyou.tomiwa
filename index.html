      <h3>Year One 💕</h3>
      <p>
        We met, we talked, we laughed.  
        I didn’t know it yet, but I was falling for you from the start.I thought it would end up like how all the others did, but you were different. Even though we had a hard time , you stayed, and thats what matters.

      <h3>Year Two 🌍</h3>
      <p>
        Distance tested us, oh it really did haha, but we made it work, we fought, we argued , we made up and we chose each other.  
        Late-night calls, patience, and us always being there for each other, this made it all worth it.
      </p>

    <div class="timeline-item">
      <h3>Year Three ❤️</h3>
      <p>
        Still here. Still us.  
        Stronger, deeper, and more sure than ever. I would have never thought that future me would be in a long distance relationship for 3 years, but here I am , and I will chose you over and over again because I love you tomiwa, from the bottom of my heart and I pray that nothing makes you think otherwise. I am so grateful for you and I can’t wait to see what the future holds for us.

      <h3>Dear My Love,</h3>
      <p>
        Three years with you has taught me what love really means.
        Even with the distance, you’ve made me feel safe, loved and understood.
        You always show up for me , love me, and make me feel like the most special person in the world. Entering this 3rd year with you has made me realize that I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I can’t wait to see you again, to hold you, and to make more memories together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for your patience, your kindness, your constant reassurance, and the way you always show up for me.
        I’m so grateful for you and even in my next life, I would look for you and choose you again and again. I love you so much, tomiwa. You are my heart, my soul, and my everything.
      </p>

      <h3>Another Little Truth 💕</h3>
      <p>
        Loving you hasn’t always been easy, but it has always been worth it.
        Every time the distance felt overwhelming, every time we fought and it felt like the end, every time my heart skipped when you get mad at me, every time, i still choose you. I choose us. I choose our love. I choose you, tomiwa, every single day, and I will continue to choose you for the rest of my life. You are my forever and always, and I am so grateful to have you in my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love you, tomiwa. Always.
